//Using the mongoose-encryption package - Always use the plugin for the encryption
//before creating a model
userSchema.plugin(encrypt, { secret: process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, encryptedFields: ['password'] });
const encrypt = require('mongoose-encryption');

Lesson 3 Md5
const md5 = require('md5');
//md5 was used here to hash the password so the hashed version of
    //both passwords would be compared.
